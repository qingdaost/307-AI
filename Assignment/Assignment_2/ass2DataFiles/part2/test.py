class SymbolicRegressor(BaseSymbolic, RegressorMixin):

    """A Genetic Programming symbolic regressor.

    A symbolic regressor is an estimator that begins by building a population
    of naive random formulas to represent a relationship. The formulas are
    represented as tree-like structures with mathematical functions being
    recursively applied to variables and constants. Each successive generation
    of programs is then evolved from the one that came before it by selecting
    the fittest individuals from the population to undergo genetic operations
    such as crossover, mutation or reproduction.

    Parameters
    ----------
    population_size : integer, optional (default=500)
        The number of programs in each generation.

    generations : integer, optional (default=10)
        The number of generations to evolve.

    tournament_size : integer, optional (default=20)
        The number of programs that will compete to become part of the next
        generation.

    stopping_criteria : float, optional (default=0.0)
        The required metric value required in order to stop evolution early.

    const_range : tuple of two floats, optional (default=(-1., 1.))
        The range of constants to include in the formulas.

    init_depth : tuple of two ints, optional (default=(2, 6))
        The range of tree depths for the initial population of naive formulas.
        Individual trees will randomly choose a maximum depth from this range.
        When combined with `init_method='half and half'` this yields the well-
        known 'ramped half and half' initialization method.

    init_method : str, optional (default='half and half')
        - 'grow' : Nodes are chosen at random from both functions and
          terminals, allowing for smaller trees than `init_depth` allows. Tends
          to grow asymmetrical trees.
        - 'full' : Functions are chosen until the `init_depth` is reached, and
          then terminals are selected. Tends to grow 'bushy' trees.
        - 'half and half' : Trees are grown through a 50/50 mix of 'full' and
          'grow', making for a mix of tree shapes in the initial population.

    function_set : iterable, optional (default=('add', 'sub', 'mul', 'div'))
        The functions to use when building and evolving programs. This iterable
        can include strings to indicate either individual functions as outlined
        below, or you can also include your own functions as built using the
        ``make_function`` factory from the ``functions`` module.

        Available individual functions are:

        - 'add' : addition, arity=2.
        - 'sub' : subtraction, arity=2.
        - 'mul' : multiplication, arity=2.
        - 'div' : protected division where a denominator near-zero returns 1.,
          arity=2.
        - 'sqrt' : protected square root where the absolute value of the
          argument is used, arity=1.
        - 'log' : protected log where the absolute value of the argument is
          used and a near-zero argument returns 0., arity=1.
        - 'abs' : absolute value, arity=1.
        - 'neg' : negative, arity=1.
        - 'inv' : protected inverse where a near-zero argument returns 0.,
          arity=1.
        - 'max' : maximum, arity=2.
        - 'min' : minimum, arity=2.
        - 'sin' : sine (radians), arity=1.
        - 'cos' : cosine (radians), arity=1.
        - 'tan' : tangent (radians), arity=1.

    metric : str, optional (default='mean absolute error')
        The name of the raw fitness metric. Available options include:

        - 'mean absolute error',
        - 'mse' for mean squared error,
        - 'rmse' for root mean squared error.

    parsimony_coefficient : float or "auto", optional (default=0.001)
        This constant penalizes large programs by adjusting their fitness to
        be less favorable for selection. Larger values penalize the program
        more which can control the phenomenon known as 'bloat'. Bloat is when
        evolution is increasing the size of programs without a significant
        increase in fitness, which is costly for computation time and makes for
        a less understandable final result. This parameter may need to be tuned
        over successive runs.

        If "auto" the parsimony coefficient is recalculated for each generation
        using c = Cov(l,f)/Var( l), where Cov(l,f) is the covariance between
        program size l and program fitness f in the population, and Var(l) is
        the variance of program sizes.

    p_crossover : float, optional (default=0.9)
        The probability of performing crossover on a tournament winner.
        Crossover takes the winner of a tournament and selects a random subtree
        from it to be replaced. A second tournament is performed to find a
        donor. The donor also has a subtree selected at random and this is
        inserted into the original parent to form an offspring in the next
        generation.

    p_subtree_mutation : float, optional (default=0.01)
        The probability of performing subtree mutation on a tournament winner.
        Subtree mutation takes the winner of a tournament and selects a random
        subtree from it to be replaced. A donor subtree is generated at random
        and this is inserted into the original parent to form an offspring in
        the next generation.

    p_hoist_mutation : float, optional (default=0.01)
        The probability of performing hoist mutation on a tournament winner.
        Hoist mutation takes the winner of a tournament and selects a random
        subtree from it. A random subtree of that subtree is then selected
        and this is 'hoisted' into the original subtrees location to form an
        offspring in the next generation. This method helps to control bloat.

    p_point_mutation : float, optional (default=0.01)
        The probability of performing point mutation on a tournament winner.
        Point mutation takes the winner of a tournament and selects random
        nodes from it to be replaced. Terminals are replaced by other terminals
        and functions are replaced by other functions that require the same
        number of arguments as the original node. The resulting tree forms an
        offspring in the next generation.

        Note : The above genetic operation probabilities must sum to less than
        one. The balance of probability is assigned to 'reproduction', where a
        tournament winner is cloned and enters the next generation unmodified.

    p_point_replace : float, optional (default=0.05)
        For point mutation only, the probability that any given node will be
        mutated.

    max_samples : float, optional (default=1.0)
        The fraction of samples to draw from X to evaluate each program on.

    warm_start : bool, optional (default=False)
        When set to ``True``, reuse the solution of the previous call to fit
        and add more generations to the evolution, otherwise, just fit a new
        evolution.

    n_jobs : integer, optional (default=1)
        The number of jobs to run in parallel for `fit`. If -1, then the number
        of jobs is set to the number of cores.

    verbose : int, optional (default=0)
        Controls the verbosity of the evolution building process.

    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, optional (default=None)
        If int, random_state is the seed used by the random number generator;
        If RandomState instance, random_state is the random number generator;
        If None, the random number generator is the RandomState instance used
        by `np.random`.
