Then he put this up on the sands at the point where he had first come to land. On the sides of the board he made a cut every day with his knife, every seventh cut being twice as long as the rest, and every first day of the month twice as long as that long one. In this way he was able to keep a record of days, weeks, months, and years.  We have said nothing so far of the fact that Crusoe took off from the damaged ship two cats; and that the dog which was on the ship came with him on his first journey back to land, and became his good friend for a number of years.  Having put all his stores in order, he got to work to make some necessary things, and was able to make a table and a seat with the short bits of board which he had got from the ship. In addition, he put up shelves and hooks in his store-place for his guns, instruments and arms.  He had taken pens, ink, and paper from the ship, and he kept a day-book, in which he gave a detailed account of all his doings for as long as he had ink.
